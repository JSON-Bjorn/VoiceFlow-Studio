# VoiceFlow Studio

VoiceFlow Studio is an AI-powered podcast generation platform currently under development. The goal is to make professional-quality podcast creation accessible to everyone, allowing users to generate engaging audio content from a simple text prompt.

## Project Vision
VoiceFlow Studio aims to democratize podcast creation by enabling anyone to generate professional, engaging audio content through AI. Users will input a topic and receive a complete podcast episode featuring a natural conversation between two AI hosts.

## Planned Features
- **Text-to-Podcast Generation:** Enter a topic and get a 5–15 minute podcast episode, with a natural-sounding conversation between two distinct AI hosts (Björn & Felix).
- **AI Host Personalities:** Consistent, engaging personalities for each host—one curious and enthusiastic, the other knowledgeable and analytical.
- **Voice Synthesis:** High-quality, human-like voices using premium TTS APIs (e.g., ElevenLabs).
- **Professional Audio Output:** Automatic background music, intro/outro, and audio post-production for a polished result.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple web interface for entering topics, adjusting settings, and downloading or listening to generated podcasts.
- **Automated Research:** The system will gather relevant information from sources like Wikipedia to ensure accurate and engaging content.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Initial support for Swedish and English.

## Target Users
- **Students & Educators:** For creating educational audio content.
- **Content Creators & Hobbyists:** For quickly generating podcast drafts and ideas.
- **Professionals & Researchers:** For summarizing topics and sharing knowledge in audio format.

## Technology Stack (Planned)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit or similar (for rapid prototyping, UI isnt as important)
- **AI/ML:** Claude, OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, ElevenLabs TTS (whatever costs the least and gives the best result)
- **Audio Processing:** pydub, librosa (needs research)
- **Deployment:** Local development environment

## Project Timeline
- **Total Duration:** 4 weeks
- **MVP Deadline:** End of week 2 (core podcast generation working)
- **Polish & Testing:** Week 4
